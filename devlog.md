Ok, so we've done a lot, and I'll be real, I don't know how a lot of it works. It's like building a puzzle of my favourite car, but only seeing the backs of the pieces. I'm making things fit together in a way that sorta looks right, but it might not be a good way. For now thisis okay.

The goal is a Minimum Viable Product by Sunday. It's ambitious, but I think it is manageable. for now we haev some issues, most of which relating to my own ignorance. That being said, the GUI works. The next step is either to try to hook in Mistral so the chatinterface works to talk to the model, or get the FAISS db up and running. data ingress is still fairly beyond me, but thisis a learning excersize, after all.

I think I want to spend some time making sure I actually *get* what's going on. I've never worked with PyQt (or any python-based gui code) before, so a lot of this is trial and error and some script-kiddie behaviour. Truly despicable. So, plan of action, see if I can fix the scrolling issue, and maybe watch a tutorial video on PyQt.
